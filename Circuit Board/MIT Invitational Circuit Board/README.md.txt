These schematics entail the electrical details of our 2017-2018 Mission Possible device, as it appeared at the MIT invitational. The schematics shown here were all designed, drawn, and checked by David J Cutting, a member of the Ward Melville High School Science Olympiad A Team. 

Hardware for the device was designed and constructed in a joint effort between Prakash Sekar and David J Cutting. All code for the microcontrollers shown in the schematic was written by David J Cutting and uploaded using an Arduino Pro Mini connected to a pogo pin programmer.

David recieved the board almost two weeks prior to the invitational, and assembled all the components onto it using a solder paste stencil and a cheap reflow skillet. The total cost for the board was well over $200, so extensite testing was done on it before powerup to ensure that nothing would blow up. Nothing did, so we breathed a sigh of relief and continued with wiring and mechanical actions.

At the invitational, the device had a number of issues, a majority of which stemmed from hardware and code issues. Despite these issues, the controller board so held up perfectly. The only issue we had with the board came from the lack of larger capacitors on the motor driver actions, which has since been remedied.

We are making our schematics open source so that others may benefit from them. We also expect that most competitors won't have a way of replicating our board because of the high technical level of the assembly process. If you would like to make a board, a BOM and gerber files are available, however be warned that this is a very time consuming and risky build - screw something up and you'll be out $200 with no option but to buy new parts and rebuild (that is, unless you happen to have a hot air rework station).
